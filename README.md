Kinematics golf game made for physics class.

Drag to launch ball at desired velocity. (like Angry Birds)

Bounces, Total shot displacements, total displacement, and launch velocities will be recorded.

Vectors will also be displayed. Green for bounces, blue for shots, yellow for velocity, and pink for total.

There are penalties that add a shot to your score, and slowdown areas that increase velocity damping.
