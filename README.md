Plans for demo thing

4 levels

Ball is shot, with visualized vector label for launch velocity (degrees relative to N,S,E,W, and magnitude)
Moves and bounces off of walls to get into hole, or stops. After reaching a stop, visualize displacement vector arrows. Have various features required from lab that effect velocity (sand traps for slowing etc.)
Use tilemaps for map creation.
